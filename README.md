# constrained-innervation-abm
Agent-based model of C. elegans nerve ring assembly. Simulates how transient morphogenetic constraints, pioneer scaffolds, and local axon-axon interactions shape reproducible spatial domains and bimodal connectivity patterns, linking development to population-level wiring statistics.
